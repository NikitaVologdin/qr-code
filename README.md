## My process

Set Up the Basic Structure: Create the necessary HTML elements to represent the QR code, such as an img tag to display the QR code image.
Set Up Gulp: Configure Gulp to automate tasks like compiling Sass.
Style the QR Code: Use CSS to define the QR code's dimensions, colors, and positioning within the component.
Implement Responsiveness: Ensure the component adapts to different screen sizes using responsive design techniques.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- GULP
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design. I gained valuable experience in using Gulp to automate my development workflow. I also learned how to write Markdown to create a professional and informative README file for my project.
